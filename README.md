# Tweetflight

Tweetflight was a project that launched ten years ago, to accompany the Brightly single "Preflight Nerves", from the album Beginnings & Endings.

It was a web experiment and music video (a sort of Twitter karaoke) that went so far beyond its humble beginnings, opened so many doors for me, and is still the thing I've made that I'm most proud of.

Tweetflight would grab tweets, in real time, that matched up to the lyrics of the song. [With the announcement that Twitter is shutting down free access to their API](https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1621026986784337922) this site is now an archive, using a final collection of static tweets over and over. All good things must come to an end, and I'm really glad the ride lasted as long as it did.

## Getting started
